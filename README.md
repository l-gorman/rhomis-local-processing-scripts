# Getting Started

This is a folder showing how to process projects locally
using the RHoMIS R-package. All of the outputs in the folder
can be reproduced using only:

* Raw_Data.csv
* extractValues.R
* processData.R

The remaining folders are all outputs from the R-package.

The file `usingRHoMIS.Rmd` is an Rmarkdown file with guidance
on how I have processed the data, and how you could reproduce 
the results yourself. This is just a first run at it so it would
be great to hear your thoughts on it. If you only want to read
the output (which I recommend), I would open the file "usingRHoMIS.html"
file. This should open directly in your browser. If it does not, then
simply right-click and manually select open in browser.
