# RHoMIS 2.0 Local Processing Scripts

This is a suggested setup for processing RHoMIS data sets locally, using the [RHoMIS R-package](https://github.com/l-gorman/rhomis-R-package).

## Getting the Code
### Using the Command Line

This is a folder showing how to process projects locally
using the RHoMIS R-package. If you are familiar with using the command line, and have git installed, you can clone and rename the repository using the command:

`git clone https://github.com/l-gorman/rhomis-local-processing-scripts.git PROJECT_NAME`

*Replace `PROJECT_NAME` with the project name you would like to use.*

### Manual Download

Alternatively, download the whole repository by selecting the drop-down menu labelled 'code', then selecting the 'Download ZIP' option. Once you have downloaded the zip, extract the files into a folder where you would like to conduct the analysis. It can be helpful to give this folder a meaningful name (e.g. a project name)

## Processing Datasets

The file `usingRHoMIS.Rmd` contains guidance
on how I have processed the data. This is still under development so it would
be great to hear your thoughts on it. You can open this documentation in your browser by opening the file `usingRHoMIS.html`
file. This should open directly in your browser. If it does not, then
simply right-click and manually select open in browser.
